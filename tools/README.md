This tool is written in PHP and uses a CSS/JS Minifier + Zip Archiver to build all libraries in the ../source/ folder into a single library.

The result is an archive containing a minified and uncompressed version of the library. 

If you want to include your own custom modules, place them in the ../source/custom/ folder with a .js extension and make sure they follow the correct format.

The tool comes with a simple interface to use. To make this work, you can either upload the repository to a web host and navigate to the tools folder, or you can extract the repository on your local server (e.g. using XAMPP on Windows) in the htdocs folder.
