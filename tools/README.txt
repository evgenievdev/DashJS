This tool is written in PHP and uses a CSS/JS Minifier + Zip Archiver to build all libraries in the ../source/ folder into a single library.
The result is an archive containing a minified and uncompressed version of the library. 
If you want to include your own custom modules, place them in the ../source/custom/ folder with a .js extension and makes sure they follow the correct format.
